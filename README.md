# Pinch Rehabilitation VR Personalized Treatment

So, this is my and [Bar Attaly](https://github.com/Barattaly) final project in Software Engineering B.sc in Ort Braude College.

## Introduction
Patients recovering from accidents or strokes often need rehabilitation exercises for improving the performance of their fingers. Specifically the performance of pinch movement is crucial for everyday action such as picking up objects, holding a pen or switching a key. Such practice for the fingers is done within their rehabilitation training but that is often not enough.

Using Virtual Reality we implemented a system that assists such patients in practicing their finger pinch movements independently, by an experiential and challenging game. The stages of the game will be individually suited to each patient, relative to the level of difficulty the patient is able to cope with, while providing feedback on how the exercises performed during the game. In addition, the therapist will be able to track the progress of each of his patients, without close monitoring when performing the exercises (unlike in a regular rehabilitation institute). Thereby the therapist can take care of a few patients simultaneously, without compromising the quality of the treatment itself.
